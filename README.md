## Abstract

Persistent discrimination against LGBTQI* people, along with recent developments such as rising violence and current backlash in some regions, highlights the urgent need for research on the (changing) living conditions of LGBTQI* people. However, current research on LGBTQI* people is often hindered by data limitations and gaps, and many survey providers and researchers struggle‚ÄØto incorporate queer perspectives into surveys adequately. This talk will give an overview of different methods, opportunities, and challenges of integrating queer perspectives in survey research. Based on practical examples and personal experiences, the talk will provide insights into the measurement of sexual orientation and gender identity, different sampling methods for reaching LGBTQI* people, and questionnaire design beyond heteronormativity. Finally, the talk will highlight the challenges and opportunities of data analysis in light of current research and developments.
